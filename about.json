    "bio": "Hi there! \n My name is Maripi and I am a web developer with a background in architecture. I recently made the decision to switch careers and pursue my passion for building elegant and functional websites. As an architect, I have developed strong problem-solving and design skills that I believe will translate well to web development. In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar, rock climbing, hiking, and playing board games. \nI am excited to bring my skills and experiences as a latino woman to new projects and clients. Thank you for visiting my portfolio!"
